# HackerPot

It's an IoT device controlled by the means of a ```HackerPot.py``` class that can be used externally by any HoneyPot software. At the moment, I modified HoneyPy and its plugin TelnetDebian7 to recieve and call an instance of a HackerPot on the relevant moments to define attacks of interest.
