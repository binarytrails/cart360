                    With the help of a multimeter borrowed from the sensor lab, try to find several conductive/semi-conductive materials and/or objects. Trash cans, food vendors, your body, stationery, and parks are good places to start looking... Analyze and document the physical, electrical, structural, perceptual and aesthetic properties for each item found.

                <b>Lime</b> : I wanted to know what plants can achieve it. It lead me to discover the lime which not only conducts but also generates electricty according to many youtube videos. The instruction where pretty straight forward indicating a lime can start an LED directly.

            <p>
                After sacrificing a poor lime in the name of science, I discovered that it dind't worked. Actually, the electricity generated from the lime is due to a chemical reaction involving Copper (Cu) and Zinc (Zn).

                <b>Salt</b> : By logic, it is made of NaCl where Na is positive and Cl is negative. Thus, it should work in water by connecting to their opposite parts comming from the anode and cathode.

            <p>
                <i>Think of different ways you could design a binary interface that utilizes a physical electric switch (i.e. a transistor) as its sole input. This interface must use at least one of the conductive materials/objects that you discovered in your research. Try to imagine a scenario for your binary interface that is not straightforward or too functional. Explain the spatial, temporal and social contexts of your scenario. Describe with a storyboard how the interaction (human -> binary interface) would work.</i>

                I was thinking of way to integrate salt with something else to create a certain usage of this element. In the context of our house, I found an old gift from friends in Brazil which was a Shisha. I was thinking that this objects looks great and for some reason I didn't really had it as a decorative object. It was in box in a dirty state.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                The latter made me realize that it could be used as a lamp. Moreover, salt has cleaning proprieties against tar residue found after combustion and it has electrical conductivity which can act as a switch indicating that it is time to change the water. It would not only be a lamp but an object enhancing your health by cleaning the water through which you will inhale the next time you smoke.

                <b>Caution: Salt can remove cheap painting found in the lower interior of your waterpipe.</b>

                On the top, the voltage is of 1.5V * 3 = 4.5 V. On the left, there is 3 LEDs in parallel and on the right the switch is the water which will conduct electricity after a little delay when the salt (NaCl) is put inside.

                - Build the interface (on a bread board is fine).</br>

                Here is chronological building process :
                </br></br>
                At first, I started by testing the conductivity of the metal on the waterpipe :
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <a href="images/interface/1.jpg">
                    <img src="images/interface/1.jpg"></img>
                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Then, I tested the conductivity of the salt water :
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <a href="images/interface/2.jpg">
                    <img src="images/interface/2.jpg"></img>
                </a>
                <a href="images/interface/3.jpg">
                    <img src="images/interface/3.jpg"></img>
                </a>
                <a href="images/interface/4.jpg">
                    <img src="images/interface/4.jpg"></img>
                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Afterwards, I found a way to connect two wires together without a welding machine to pass it through the main pipe into the bottem recipient :
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <a href="images/interface/5.jpg">
                    <img src="images/interface/5.jpg"></img>
                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Then, I found another way to connect the LEDs to this wire aligning the Cathodes (-) in center (shorter leg) and leaving the Anode (+) outside to create a circuit in parallel of three lights :
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <a href="images/interface/6.jpg">
                    <img src="images/interface/6.jpg"></img>
                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                This led me to connect the Anode (longer leg) to the Shisha top metal using Aluminium that I rubbed around the head of the waterpipe :
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <a href="images/interface/7.jpg">

                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Et la lumi√®re fut!

                By looking into the bottom of the pipe, we can see tiny bubles created from separation of the NaCl :

                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Lets turn out the lights and observe the lamp aesthetics :
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <a href="images/interface/10.jpg">
                    <img src="images/interface/10.jpg"></img>
                </a>
                <a href="images/interface/11.jpg">
                    <img src="images/interface/11.jpg"></img>
                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Let's put everything together! First, we shall enhance the charger aesthetics by hiding it into a container of the smoking material often found near a Shisha.
            </p>
            <div class="images">
                <a href="images/interface/12.jpg">

                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                Then, let's add another wire into the bottom which would receive the positive current from the batteries, it will pass through salt water arriving into the negative wire that will go up to the LEDs, light them up and go into the positive LED leg through the alluminium into the Shisha metal which will led it back into the charger.
            </p>
