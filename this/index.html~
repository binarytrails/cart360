                    Visit any electronic suppliers’ website and do a catalogue search for at least three interesting over-the-counter ANALOG sensors. Document the specifications of these three sensors i.e. voltage requirements, resistance, sampling value ranges etc., along with how these sensors are used with the Arduino and any special requirements to utilise the sensor(s) i.e. external libraries.
                    </br></br>
                    Then, choose at least one of the researched ANALOG sensors that could be incorporated into your Assignment 2 – the selected ANALOG sensor(s) would be used as INPUT. Finally, propose and provide storyboards for three possible interaction scenarios that would use these sensor(s).

                Heartbeats are triggered by bioelectrical signals of very low amplitude generated by aspecial set of cells in the heart (the  SA node). Electrocardiography (ECG) enables the translation of theseelectrical signalsinto numerical values, enabling them to be used in a wide array of applications. Our sensor allow data acquisitionnot only at the chest (“on-the-person”), but also at the hand palms (“off-the-person”), and works both with pre-gelled and most types of dry electrodes. The bipolar configuration is ideal for low noisedata acquisition.

                Magnetism is an invisble force which omnipresent in our world and it is tighly coupled with electricity creating a Electromagnetism which is one of four fundamental forces found in nature.
                </br></br>
                I decided to explore it by creating an interactive installation involving Ferrofluid which is a liquid made of nanoscale ferromagnetic particles suspended in a carrier fluid. Ferrofluid was invented in 1963 by NASA's Steve Papell as a liquid rocket fuel that could be drawn toward a pump inlet in a weightless environment by applying a magnetic field. It is used in many other domains including electronics for hard drives and loud speakers.

            <p>
                From this point, the hardest part was to find its usage. I setteled on using the Sonar movement sensor as an Analog input but how to bind it to the ferrofluid? I dind't want to immitate what was already done. It led me to explore local grossaries shops to look for items that could incorporate the Ferrofluid inside them. I found two photo frames and miniature plastic masks.

            <p>
                It inspired me to create a frame with the ferrofluid inside it which would hide a face and when someone approaches, it reveals either this white mask or a mirror reflection of yourself. I dropped the idea of the mask because even if I integrated it inside, making pass the ferrofluid just through holes in the eyes or around would neccessitate greate control on the magnetic field which in turn would require a complex motor behind to move the magnets. Since the timeframe for this project was quite short, I decided to attempt to create a frame made of ferrofluid with a liquid inside a transparent . The latter would allow me to either place a mirror, nothing or anything else behind the ferrofluid frame. The dark frame reminded me of the Evil Queen's Magic Mirror from the Snow White tale. This made it even more conceptually interesting.

                The little oversize could be cut. This led me to explore the Wood Shop on the Concordia 8th EV floor. This place turned out being very interesting. They helped me by teaching how to cut the glass and I even found some free wood leftovers perfect for my frame container. I think it's better to create a complete object containing the circuits inside.

                I decided to use this setup to create a box inside which one can look to explore the ferrofluid reacting to its hand gestures detected by the Sonar sensor. Since, the box may be large, a horizontal layout looked more attractive than the vertical one. It would allow a user to place it anywhere in its house without trying to place it on walls at its eyes level to prevent uncomfortable bending. Plus, a vertical one would force the ferrofluid down by the earth's gravity force which would make it more hard to attract it from the bottom using magnets, without saying that all of the electronics would need to be fixed on wall inside the box. Therefore, I went with the horizontal box layout.
                </br></br>
                To seal the frame I used the Wood Shop recommendation of using water-proof Silicon :

                I applied it generously as it takes 24h to dry and since there are two sides it is a minimum of 48h. This is stressful situation because if it failes, it may also fail a second time unless the exact reason were to be found. During this waiting period, I started to think about the plan B in case this frame container would not work and I went into searching for ferrofluid solution.

                According to my research a water with a saturation of sugar should work. I tested it before to make sure and it seemed okay. The normal water is on left and the sugar water on the right :

            </br>
            <p>
                As soon as the Silicon was dried, I put some water inside to ensure it is sealed. To my relief, it sealed just fine. I decided to put some water with a saturation of sugar and fill it partially with the ferrofluid.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, I sealed the other side of the frame.

            <p>
               Obviously something didn't worked as expected... :'(
               </br></br>
               Maybe the water didn't reached saturation of sugar or the ferrofluid had a too long exposure to oxygen or maybe the sillicon has its part in it. Bottom line, this didn't worked.
                </br></br>
                I decided to keep my focus on the rest of the installation and go to the Concordia's Wood Shop.

                To move the magnet, I used the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10976">Slide Pot</a> motorized slider with a combination of a H-Bridge to control its direction by altering a Direct Current :

                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                I found an online schematic of this motor :

                </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                However, I discovered that the analog pin didn't worked by only showing its 0 - 1023 values range on the 20% of the slider. I debuged this issue for quite some time. I even tried to weld all of the pins to wires and trying altering them all :

            </div>
            <p>
                Still, no success on finding the right analog pin.

                The fact that the analog pin didn't worked as expected made it impossible to map the sensor movements to the motor ones to create a direct binding between hand motions and ferrofluid mouvement. Therefore, I fallback on the automatic movement all the way into one of the two slider's directions after any detected motions within certain proximity.

                I didn't went into fancy code with polishing because of the time constraints. Plus, it turned out that the sonar library wasn't working as well as their code examples. I used a rules to find out that the division by 8 gave me the most accurate value for sonar distance in inches.

                Due to the black frame unsuccessful liquid result, I went with the idea of creating a support to suspend any kind of ferrofuid containers. Thus, allowing user to chose to suspend anything else in the wood frame wires and control the magnetic field with hand gestures. Here is the final setup :

                <i>What is the story behind your object?</i></br></br>

                TODO: image

                </br></br>
                
                <i>Where does it come from?</i></br></br>

                From a place called earth out of an artistic human mind.
                </br></br>

                <i>Why does it exist?</i></br></br>

                The purpose of this object is to create an interactive and decorative object allowing the users to explore the magnetism through visually appealing playfulness with a ferrofluid container of any kind placed on top of the display.
                </br></br>

                <i>What is the personality of your object?</i></br></br>

                It has a simplistic, complex and yet artsy display. One can understand its nature by exploring the circuits path behind a transparent wall.
                </br></br>

                <i>How does its personality manifest itself in the physical world?</i></br></br>

                It manifests it by captivating a visitor by the sci-fi like dark liquid reacting to hand gestures.
                </br></br>

                <i>What makes your object do what it does?</i></br></br>

                There is no need for a direct interaction for this object to display the 3D magnetic field force using the ferrofluid. By default, one can observe them and with a simple hand gesture not requiring much of an effort, this person can make it move according to its interests.
                </br></br>

                <i>Is the personality of your object related to its physical manifestation?</i></br></br>

                Its personnality is related to its physical manifestation by its core reason of existance : binding Art with Science by intriguing and facinating the end user.
                </br></br>

                <i>What emotions does your object evoke/provoke?</i></br></br>

                Facination, uncertainty and feeling of magic.
                </br></br>

                <i>Are they the same for everyone?</i></br></br>

                They may vary according to people's knowledge of the ferrofluid. However, even one that knows the essence of this liquid, would still be interested into seeing and now even controlling its magnetic field using the movement sensor.
